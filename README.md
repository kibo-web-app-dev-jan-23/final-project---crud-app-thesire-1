# Multi-model CRUD App

Design and build a web application using Flask or Express.

## Requirements

Your application

- must use Flask or Express
- must use a relational database (Postgresql is recommended, if you would like to deploy your application. SQLite3 is also fine!)
- must have multiple, related database models
- must have features to Create, Read, Update, and Delete some of those models from a web interface
- must be designed such that it works properly on different devices (desktop and mobile)

You must also include a README.md file that
- explains what your app does
- explains the tables in your schema
- explains how to set the app up and run it locally

## Optional components

The following are optional, but not required:

- you may use an ORM library
- you may use a CSS framework
- you may use an API
- you may have users and authentication
- you may use  a library to manage authentication and authorization
- you may deploy your application to the web

## Recommendations

The possibilities for your application are wide and varied. Choosing a scope for your project that you can complete within the time is key.

Before you start coding, you should:
- write out a list of pages in your planned application
- write the routes associated with those pages and their actions
- write out the plan for the models in your schema

You are also highly encouraged to build a scoped-down **Minimum Viable Product** (MVP) first, then add more features after you have it working.

## Notes

- If you choose to start from a Flask or Express starter code template (like [flask-starter](https://github.com/ksh7/flask-starter) or [express-postgres-boilerplate](https://github.com/mateo-io/express-postgres-boilerplate)) you **must** mention it in your README file.
